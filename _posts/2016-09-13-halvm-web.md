We're happy to announce the creation of [`halvm-web`: the first web server for
the HaLVM](https://github.com/GaloisInc/halvm-web). The goal for `halvm-web` is
simplicity in design and implementation.  At the moment, it serves static web
content fed to it in a ramdisk. In the future we'd like to expand it only
slightly, with:

  * Logging, so people know who's hitting their site.
  * TLS support, because more crypto is more good.

We hope to get to these soon. The latter, for example, is mostly waiting on an
updated release of the Haskell TLS library. But after that, we'll likely focus
on performance and stability, rather than features. For more advanced features,
I think we're going to look at finding ways to make [the Haskell `snap`
framework](http://snapframework.com/) run on [HaLVM
v3](http://localhost:4000/article/2016/04/29/halvm3-manifesto.html).
